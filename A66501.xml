         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Honoured Sir</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Being in the Countrey, and to my great trouble ſeeing my ſelf in His Majeſty's Proclamation, I came laſt Night to Town, reſolving to lay my ſelf at His Majeſty's Feet, let him do with me what he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth; This is the firſt Crime I have been guilty of, ſince His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Reſtoration, and too ſoon by much now: If His Majeſty thinks my Death will do him more good than my Life, God's Will, and His be done. Until I ſent your Honour this Letter, my Life was in my own power, but now it is in the King's; to whom I do moſt humbly propoſe, That if His Majeſty deſires it, I will diſcover to him all that I know relating to <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> or <hi>Ireland;</hi> which I ſuppoſe may be ſomething more than the Original Diſcoverer was able to acquaint His Majeſty with; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as to <hi>Ireland:</hi> There is not any thing His Majeſty ſhall think fit to ask me, but I will anſwer him the Truth, as pertinently, and as fully as I can. My intimacy with a <hi>Scotch</hi> Miniſter, through whoſe Hands much of the Buſineſs went, I judge occaſioned my knowing very much: And I do further humbly propoſe, That if His Majeſty thinks it adviſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I will follow thoſe Lords and Gentlemen that are fled into <hi>Holland,</hi> as if I fled thither, and had made my Eſcape alſo, and will acquaint the King, if I can find it out, what Meaſures they reſolve of taking next: I do aſſure His Majeſty, the Buſineſs is laid very broad, or I am miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. And I am ſure as to that particular, if my being with His Majeſty, and your Honour, be not diſcovered, I ſhall be ten times abler to ſerve him, than either Mr. <hi>Freeman,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Carr;</hi> for they will truſt neither of them. There's ſcarce any thing done at Court, but is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately talk'd all the Town over; therefore if His Majeſty thinks what I have preſumed to propoſe, Adviſable, I do then further moſt humbly Propoſe, That my waiting upon His Majeſty may be ſome time within Night, that your Honour will acquaint me the Time and Place where I may wait upon you, in order to it; and that it may be within Night alſo; and that no body may be by, but His Majeſty, and your Honour; And if His Majeſty pleaſeth to Pardon my Offences for the Time paſt, he ſhall find I will approve my ſelf very Loyal for the future; if not, I reſolve to give his Majeſty no further trouble, but to lye at His Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, let him do with me what he pleaſeth. I purpoſe to ſpend much of this day in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> at leaſt from Two of the Clock to Four. I beg your Pardon I ſend your Honour this by a Porter: I aſſure your Honour, it was for no other reaſon, but becauſe I would not have a third Perſon Privy to it; and that I might have the better opportunity to make good my Word to His Majeſty, and to approve my ſelf</p>
